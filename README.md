# pto

Calculate your future Paid Time Off (PTO) accrual.

Many companies have a PTO policy that accru on a daily basis.
Alas, sometimes accrual stops at a certain "cap".
Run this program to figure out when that happens.

## Usage

```
ruby ./pto --accrual 288.96/8 --cap 364/8 --rate 26

Cap is hit in 132 days - on 2021-05-20. Please take some PTO before then :-)
```
